## Travel agency 

This is my last assignment on my HTML and CSS course at my fullstack web developer program at Nackademin. 

The idea were to do some kind of event/web shop/product-ish web page design in SCSS. 

My web page is a travel/experience agency where you can book experience that suits you.
